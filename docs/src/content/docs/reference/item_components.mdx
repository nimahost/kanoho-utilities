title: Item Components
description: Explore the item components offered by Kanoho Utilities.

Inspired by vanilla's [Data Components](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_component_format),
Kanoho's item components provide a powerful way to add custom functionality to items.

Kanoho's components are stored as [NBT tags](https://minecraft.wiki/w/NBT_format), and are always reside inside a `kanoho` compound tag.
For example, to give yourself an everlasting steak, you use the following command:

```mcfunction "kanoho:{consumed: false}"
give @p minecraft:cooked_beef[minecraft:custom_data={kanoho:{consumed: false}}] 1
```

:::note
	Item components are currently located within the `minecraft:custom_data` data component. However, this may change in
	the future.
