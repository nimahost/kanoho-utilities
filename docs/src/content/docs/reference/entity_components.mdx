title: Entity Components
description: Explore the entity components offered by Kanoho Utilities.

Inspired by vanilla's [Data Components](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_component_format),
Kanoho's entity components provide powerful new ways of obtaining data about entities.

Kanoho's components are stored as [NBT tags](https://minecraft.wiki/w/NBT_format), and always reside within a `kanoho` compound tag.
For example, check if enderpearls are on cooldown you could use the following command:

```mcfunction
execute if data entity @s {kanoho:{cooldowns:["minecraft:ender_pearl"]}} # etc...
```
