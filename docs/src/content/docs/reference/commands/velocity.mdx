title: Velocity Command
description: Learn how Kanoho's velocity command works.
---

The velocity command allows you to modify the velocity of players. This is already possible for non-player entities in vanilla, but the velocity command allows more flexibility regarding the direction and magnitude of the velocity applied.

### Usage

```plaintext
velocity <targets> (set|add) <velocity>
```

| Argument   | Type                                                         | Description                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `targets`  | [target selector](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Target_selectors) | The entities to modify the velocity of. |
| `velocity` | [vector 3](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Argument_types#vec3)     | The velocity to set/add to the entity.  |

### How Velocity is Calculated

The `velocity` argument supports absolute values as well as [tilde and caret notations](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Coordinates#Commands).
However, they will be calculated as a **multiplier** on the the **executor's** current velocity, not the command's position.

For example, using tilde notation you could set `Player1`'s velocity to be the same as `Player2`'s, with the following command:

```mcfunction
execute as Player1 run velocity set Player2 ~1 ~1 ~1
```

:::note
As tilde notation is a **multiplier**, using `~ ~ ~` without any values will set their velocity to `0`.
:::

Caret notation can be used to appy velocity in the direction the executor is currently looking, for example:

```mcfunction
velocity add @s ^ ^ ^1
```
